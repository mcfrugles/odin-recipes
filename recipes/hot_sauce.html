    <h2>This is my go to recipe for the perfect hot sauce.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g green and red chillies, stalks removed and cut in half lengthways</li>
        <li>2 large brown onions, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rapeseed or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>100g light brown sugar</li>
        <li>450g ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>150ml apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the prepared chillies, onions and garlic into a food processor and blend until quite smooth â€“ the seeds will still be visible.</li>
        <li>Put the oil in a large saucepan over a moderate heat, then add the chilli, onion and garlic paste. Fry for 8-10 mins, stirring frequently, to soften the ingredients, but take care that they don't burn.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, tomatoes and vinegar, and simmer for a further 15 mins until the sauce has thickened a little. Blend again, if desired, taste and adjust the seasoning if needed. If you like a very smooth texture, strain through a fine sieve. Leave to cool, then store in a sterilised jar. Will keep chilled for up to a month in an airtight jar.</li>
    </ol>
